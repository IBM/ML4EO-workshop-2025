# ML4EO-workshop-2025
A hands-on workshop on using Prithvi-EO-2.0 and Terramind, prepared for the [Machine Learning for Earth Observation conference, 2025](https://ml4eo.org/). There are two notebooks focused on using Geospatial AI Foundation models:

- [Prithvi-EO-2.0 (HLS)](/Prithvi-EO/)
    - Multi-temporal Data (Crop segmentation)
- [Terramind](/TerraMind/)
    - Multi-modal Disaster response using S1, S2

Each notebook can be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment, preferable with access to GPUs.

# Prerequisites
1. Python
1. Machine Learning knowledge
1. Some understanding of Geo-spatial datasets.

# Getting started
This workshop will make use of [Colab](https://colab.google/) as a hosted Jupyter Notebook service. You must be logged in with a Google Account to use the service. Complete the following steps to get started!
1. Navigate to [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/).![colab](images/colab-1.png)
1. Select File > Open Notebook![open notebook](images/open-notebook.png)
1. Select `GitHub` and enter `https://github.com/IBM/ML4EO-workshop-2025` into the search box. Select one of the two Notebooks to start working.![github](images/github.png)
1. Optionally authorize GitHub to be used with CoLab. This will enable changes to be saved in GitHub but is not necessary to complete the Workshop.
1. Select Additional connection options > Change runtime type > Select T4 GPU > Save. ![Additional connection options 2](images/additional-connection-options-2.png)
